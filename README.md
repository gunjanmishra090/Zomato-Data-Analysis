  analysis, we discover interesting facts about restaurants, what people like to eat, how much they spend, and how 
  popular services like online delivery are in different cities. If you're  data enthusiast, aspiring analyst, or 
  someone curious about food tech trends this analysis offers a comprehensive look at how data drives decision-making 
  in the food industry.
